### Math Operations Project
  In this project I created math functions in JavaScript and called them in HTML. In this I used addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, order of operations, unary operator, increment, decrement, and a random number generator. To call these functions, I used document.getElementById, document.write, and window.alert in combonation with the onload, onlclik, ondblckick, oncontextmenu, onmouseover, and onmouseout events.

### Function Challenge
  This was a challenge to create my own function and to call it with the document.getElementById method. I used a simple multiplication function with two variables that get called using onclick.

### Functions Project
  This was a simple project where I create a function that concatenated two strings and then to call and display it with an event using the getElementById method.

### Event Challenge
  In this challenge, the assignment was to research and correctly use a new event and event handler. I created an HTML input element and used oninput to call an alert function.

### Concatenated String Challenge
  In this simple assignment, I assigned a concatenated string to a variable and used the document.write method to display the whole variable.
  
### String Assignment
  In this assignment, I assigned a string to a variable and used a window.alert method to display the variable.

### Alert and Expressions Project
  This was a simple project to demonstrate early JavaScript functions and methods. In it I assigned string values, used the window.alert and document.write method, concatenated strings, used an exit character, wrote comments, and wrote an expression with the result printed using document.write.
