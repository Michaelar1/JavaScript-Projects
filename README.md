### Scope, Time, and Function Project
  In this HTML and JavaScript Project, I wrote a function using a global variable, wrote a function using a local variable, intentionally wrote a function that had an error that would display in the Console, and wrote functions with if, else, and if else statements. I also used "new Date().getHours()" in two functions to pull the time from the user's computer.

### Ternary Operators and Constructors Project
  In this HTML and JavaScript Project, I used a ternary operator, an object constructor, and a nested function.

### Reserved Keyword Challenge
  For this challenge, I assigned a variable the value of a reserved word to see the results - the event does not work. Also, I wrote an object constructor function.
  
### Keyword Assignment
  This assignment was a simple practice of object constructors and their use. Here I use both "this" and "new" keywords. 

### Voting Age Challenge
  In this challenge, I used a ternary operator to create a functional HTML document that is able to receive input for an age and return whether or not that person is old enough to vote.

### Comparisons, Type, and Coercion Project
  In this project, I used the typeof operator, combine a string and a number in an expression, have the browser display Infinity and -Infinity, use boolean logic, use both the == and the == operators, use && and || operators, and use the ! operator.

### Boolean Challenge
  In this challenge, using the console.log() method, I made the browser's Developer Tools console display "false" using Boolean Logic.

### Not a Number Challenge
  This was a challenge to use NaN functions to get the browser to display NaN for a function, true for a function using isNaN, and false for a function using isNan.

### Dictionary Project
  In this project, I created a dictionary with JavaScript, called the dictionary function in HTML, and then went back into JavaScript and deleted the KVP being called by the funciton with a delete statement.

### Math Operations Project
  In this project I created math functions in JavaScript and called them in HTML. In this I used addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, order of operations, unary operator, increment, decrement, and a random number generator. To call these functions, I used document.getElementById, document.write, and window.alert in combonation with the onload, onlclik, ondblckick, oncontextmenu, onmouseover, and onmouseout events.

### Function Challenge
  This was a challenge to create my own function and to call it with the document.getElementById method. I used a simple multiplication function with two variables that get called using onclick.

### Functions Project
  This was a simple project where I create a function that concatenated two strings and then to call and display it with an event using the getElementById method.

### Event Challenge
  In this challenge, the assignment was to research and correctly use a new event and event handler. I created an HTML input element and used oninput to call an alert function.

### Concatenated String Challenge
  In this simple assignment, I assigned a concatenated string to a variable and used the document.write method to display the whole variable.
  
### String Assignment
  In this assignment, I assigned a string to a variable and used a window.alert method to display the variable.

### Alert and Expressions Project
  This was a simple project to demonstrate early JavaScript functions and methods. In it I assigned string values, used the window.alert and document.write method, concatenated strings, used an exit character, wrote comments, and wrote an expression with the result printed using document.write.
